## Requirements

- PHP 7.0+

## Installing

Use Composer to install it:

```
composer require pragmarx/countries
```

## Instantiating

```php
use PragmaRX\Countries\Package\Countries;

echo $countries->where('cca2', 'IT')->first()->hydrateCurrencies()->currencies->EUR->coins->frequent->first();

// or calling it statically

echo Countries::where('cca2', 'IT')->first()->hydrateCurrencies()->currencies->EUR->coins->frequent->first();
```

Should both return 

```
€1
```

Overloading the default configuration:

```php
use PragmaRX\Countries\Package\Services\Config;

$countries = new Countries(new Config([
    'hydrate' => [
        'elements' => [
            'currencies' => true,
            'flag' => true,
            'timezones' => true,
        ],
    ],
]));
```

#

## Usage

This package is not tied to Laravel and doesn't require it to be installed (we have a [bridge](https://github.com/antonioribeiro/countries-laravel) for this purpose), but it has [Laravel Collections](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/collections) in its core, all methods in Collections are available, this way you can do things like filter, map, reduce, search, sort, reject, and a lot more. It, actually, uses [Coollection](https://github.com/antonioribeiro/coollection), which is Laravel Collections with a fluent syntax, allowing us to have access to array keys (and values) as object properties.

To get all countries in the data base you just have to:

```php
use PragmaRX\Countries\Package\Countries;

$countries = new Countries();

$all = $countries->all();
```

To get a json you:

```php
return $countries->toJson();
```

Filter by keys and values:

```php
$countries->where('name.common', 'Brazil')
```

Will find Brazil by its common name, which is a

```
#items: array:22 [▼
  "name" => array:3 [▼
    "common" => "Brazil"
    "official" => "Federative Republic of Brazil"
    "native" => array:1 [▼
      "por" => array:2 [▼
        "official" => "República Federativa do Brasil"
        "common" => "Brasil"
      ]
    ]
  ]
```

Or alternatively you can filter like this

```php
$countries->whereNameCommon('Brazil')
```

And, you can go deepeer

```php
$countries->where('name.native.por.common', 'Brasil')
```

Or search by the country top level domain

```php
$countries->where('tld.0', '.ch')
```

To get

```
"name" => array:3 [▼
  "common" => "Switzerland"
  "official" => "Swiss Confederation"
  "native" => array:4 [▶]
]
"tld" => array:1 [▼
  0 => ".ch"
]
```
And use things like pluck

```php
$countries->where('cca3', 'USA')->first()->hydrateStates()->states->pluck('name', 'postal')
```

To get

```php
"MA" => "Massachusetts"
"MN" => "Minnesota"
"MT" => "Montana"
"ND" => "North Dakota"
...
```

The package uses a modified Collection which allows you to access properties and methods as objects:

```php
$countries->where('cca3', 'FRA')
         ->first()
         ->borders
         ->first()
         ->name
         ->official
```

Should give

```
Principality of Andorra
```

Borders hydration is disabled by default, but you can have your borders hydrated easily by calling the hydrate method:

```php
$countries->where('name.common', 'United Kingdom')
         ->hydrate('borders')
         ->first()
         ->borders
         ->reverse()
         ->first()
         ->name
         ->common
```

Should return

```
Ireland
````

### Hydration

To improve performance, hydration, which is enabled by default, can be disable on most country properties, and this is how you manually hydrate properties:

```php
$countries->where('name.common', 'United States')->first()->hydrate('timezones')->timezones->first()->zone_name,

$countries->where('name.common', 'United States')->first()->hydrate('timezones')->timezones->first()->zone_name,
```

Those are some of the hydratable properties:

- Borders
- Cities
- Currencies
- Flag
- Geometry
- Languages
- States
- Taxes
- Timezone
- Topology

### Extra where rules
Some properties are stored differently and we therefore need special rules for accessing them, these properties are
- `ISO639_3` => The 3 letter language code.
- `ISO4217`  => The 3 letter currency code.

You can of course access them like other properties
```php
$countries->whereISO639_3('por')->count()
$countries->where('ISO639_3', 'por')->count()
```

### Mapping
Sometimes you would like to access a property by a different name, this can be done in settings, this way
```php
'maps' => [
    'lca3' => 'ISO639_3'
]
```
Here we bind the language 3 letter short code ISO format to `lca3`, which is short for `language code alpha 3-letter`.
So now we can access the property by
```php
$countries->whereLca3('por')
```
Or
```php
$countries->where('lca3', 'por')
```

## Flags

Countries provides many different flag sources, including SVG flags. This is how you use one of the available sources:

### Install [flag-icon](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css)

```
npm install --save-dev flag-icon-css
```

### Import it to your project

```
@import '~flag-icon-css/sass/flag-icon.scss';
```

### Use Countries to get the flag span

```
$unitedStatesFlag = 
    $this->countries->where('cca3', 'USA')
    ->first()
    ->flag
    ->flag_icon;
```

### Render it in your blade template

```
{!! $unitedStatesFlag !!}
```

## Publishing assets

You can publish configuration by doing:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider=PragmaRX\\Countries\\ServiceProvider
```

## Data

This package uses some other open source packages and, until we don't build a better documentation, you can find some more info about data on [mledoze/countries](https://github.com/mledoze/countries/blob/master/README.md) and how to use it on this fantastic [Laravel News article](https://laravel-news.com/countries-and-currencies).

## Cache

Since this data is not supposed to change, calls are automatically cached.
If you want to change this behaviour, you can edit `config/countries.php` file once it's published.
