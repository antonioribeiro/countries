2017-10-15: 4.0.0

- Many thanks to the over 50 people who contributed to the v4 release of Natural Earth, we couldn't do it without you! Jeremy, @raffam, @pnorman, @mojodna, @imresamu, Hannes, Axel, @pinakographo, @CaucasusandMercury, @jschleuss, Martha, Kuba, Jesús, Arkadiy, Philip, Benedikt, Ivor, @almccon, Jacob, Alice, Geoffrey, @ajmas, @instantdelay, Matt, Daniel, Felix, @karimbahgat, @migurski, Olaf, @mvexel, @yaph, Jessica, @kernc, Quentin, Peter, @xangregg, Roland, Rob, @teahan36, @dgddgd, @dkerkow, Graham, Michel, @dshorthouse, @pinakographos, Alain, Aileen, Daniel, Charles, Martin, Aaron, MattA, StephenE, NathanielD, and others.

GENERAL

1) The v4 series introduces significant changes to admin-0 country shapes to account for the disputed area of Crimea, and several important admin-0 country name changes like Czechia renamed from Czech Republic. Admin-0 population and GDP values have also been updated to 2016/2017 vintage (primarily from CIA World Factbook).
2) The v4 series introduces web map optimized min_zoom, min_label, max_label properties that compliment the existing scalerank property that was originally curated for print cartography in proper projection glory. The min_zoom property is optimized for the web Mercator projection we are collectively hallucinating, and the min_label and max_label properties are optional on some themes when the label should be displayed later than the feature's geometry (or should stop showing). Fixes: #200, #202.
3) While the v3 series went full UTF-8 unicode (character encoding) language support a few errors were made along the way. v4 fixes bad Windows-1252 to UTF-8 conversion bugs. We also better document with the character encoding by adding a .cpg file to shapefile, and on the Natural Earth website documentation. Fixes #89, #186, 4RUN1M5S75; thanks Jeremy and @pnorman.
4) We added French names for marine areas way back in v1.4.0, and v4 adds many thousand more for populated places in the following languages: name_en, name_de, name_es, name_fr, name_pt, name_ru, name_zh. The existing name, name_alt, and nameascii fields have been updated, and name features over 600 labels with accent marks (versus the 80 or so that were garbled in the v3 series).

GENERAL

1) Updates to the admin-1 layer in 10m series to radically increase coverage, quality, and
move towards fully UTF-8 based Shapefiles, no more GeoDB! Because everything is now SHP
format, the 50m and 110m admin-1 files have also been renamed.
2) Updates in New Zealand for coastline, rivers, lakes, geographic areas, roads, railroad,
and populated places.
3) Coastline updates in New Zealand, deletion of Sandy Island, and other admin-1 adjustments
force the admin-0, and ocean, land & some bathymetry polygons to rebuild.
4) Pinnacles National Monument elevated to National Park.
5) Salish Sea added for physical marine label areas.
6) Minor changes for Russian hydrology in 10m and 50m series.
7) Sister site quattroshapes.com launches with administrative data at nominal 1:100,000 scale.

2012-10-12: 2.0.0

- Full details: http://www.naturalearthdata.com/blog/miscellaneous/natural-earth-v2-0-0-release-notes/.

- Many thanks to the individuals who contributed over the last year of development: Tom,
Nathaniel, Alex Tait, Hans van der Maarel, Scott Zillmer, Mike Migurski, Daniel Huffman,
Xan Gregg, Peter Bispham, Drew Noakes, Miguel Angel Vilela, Matthew Toro, Kevin Pickell,
Shawn Allen, Robert Coup, Iain, Leo, and more! Thanks also to Stamen thru the Knight
Foundation Citytracking grant for sponsoring a portion of this work including remastering
geometries for better PostGIS import, the move to Github, and adopting semantic versioning.

GENERAL

- UPDATED:  NATURAL_EARTH_UPDATE_2.0.0 - This release focuses on 7 major areas:
1) Economic geography: adds global roads, railroads, ports, airports, and time zones to
show how people are interconnected and goods route.
2) Remastered geometries: fixes topological errors at 1:10 to 1:1,000 scales in the basic
coastline, ocean, land, admin-0, and admin-1 related themes for files in the the 1:10m
scaleset. By removing self-intersections, sliver polygons, and adjusting offset polygons,
Natural Earth imports into more GIS software (like PostGIS) and will be easier to
maintain. The coastline is adjusted to better conform to ~1:3,000,000 satellite imagery.
Because of all these changes, some raster themes are also updated. Land, ocean, and minor
islands all build topologically by scripting ingredients, as do the admin-0 and admin-1
cultural themes.
3) Introduce Gray Earth rasters. Worldwide terrain depicted monochromatically in shades of
gray. It combines shaded relief and regionally adjusted hypsography that emphasizes both
high mountains and the micro terrain found in lowlands. View new raster »
4) New file name and field name schemas. Full adoption of ne_10m_theme_name.shp file names
with `ne_` prefix to allow better import into GeoDB and PostGIS storage, lowercase field
(column) names instead of MiXeD and UPPER cased names, and use of consistent `name` field
(versus name1).
5) Address user submitted bug reports, ~25 since the 1.4 release, and earlier.
6) Moved to Github for the backend versioned file management and coordination. Includes
scripts to package updates and auto-create derived themes.
7) Adopt semantic versioning. Know, by theme, the level of effort needed to update your
maps when Natural Earth data updates are released.
* Other notable changes:
All themes now include README and VERSION files. The admin-0 attributes have more veracity
and now includes nested disputed areas (was a sidecar). Adds continent, region, subregion
codes. Adds versions of country and admin-1 without boundary lakes.  All places and parts
of places have population and GDP estimates. The populated places pop_max and pop_min
attributes are now fully built out for all records (pop max is for the metropolitan area,
pop_min is for the incorporated city of the same name). populated places now include
rank_max and rank_min for simple town size grading. All instances of name1 have been
changed to name, name to name, name2 to name_alt. Vertexes were added to many themes to
allow them to project into conics smoothly (they're back!). All field (column) names are
now generally in the order of: scalerank, featurecla, name, name_alt, natscale,
labelrank, *.

        confluence with the Paraguay, on up to the source.

        of the Sakonnet River and the city of Newport, and just south of Fall
        River, MA.
- CHANGED:  All US state boundary fixes: R.I.-Mass., Va.-N.C. now bends south in the

        Kan.-Col., Neb.-Co., Neb.-Wy., S.D.-Wy., S.D.-Mont., N.D.-Mont., Iowa-Mo.,

        Australia. RENAMED Niue – Is not part of Australia, but independent.
        Associated with New Zealand. DELETED as admin-1 units are not shown for small
        countries. Kerguelen Islands are part of France DELETED as admin-1 units are
        not shown for small countries.
- CHANGED:  Niassa Province in Mozambique is incorrectly spelled as ‘Nassa’. ‘Niassa’ is
        there as a varname, but the province has never been called ‘Nassa’.
- CHANGED:  Populated places (10m, 50m and 110m) - Norwegian cities, in whole related to

        Baerum -> Bærum, Svolvaer -> Svolvær, Tonsberg -> Tønsberg and
        Vadso -> Vadsø.
- CHANGED:  Baguio City in the Philippines is still the defacto summer location of the
        supreme court (judiciary branch of government), a similar situation as Chile
        and a couple other countries, but is now coded as “Admin-0 cap alt”. However,
        Quezon City and Pasay City are downgraded from Admin-0 capital alt to
        “Populated place” as the recent constitution states that the entire admin-1
        unit of Manila is the national capital and they fall inside that feature.
- CHANGED:  The place name Wiener Neustadt in Austria (that is the proper name of the
        city) had the wrong NAME attribute “Wiener”.
- CHANGED:  Across the Mekong from Nakhon Phanom (Thailand), Natural Earth has a
        settlement marked “Khammouan” in Laos. Khammouan(e) is the name of a province.
        The actual city across the river appears to be the capital of said province,
        Thakhek.
- CHANGED:  San Carlos moved east out of Lake Nicaragua.
- CHANGED:  Primarily in Iran, Egypt, and Lebanon. “Name in NEV” >> “Should be”:
        Dayr az Zawr >> Dayr az Azwr, Khoramabad >> Khorramabad,
        Shahr E Kord >> Shar e Kord, Zagizig >> Zagazig, Damanhr >> Damanhur,
        Nabatiyet et Tahta >> Nabatiye et Tahta
- CHANGED:  Greeneville, NC should be Greenville, NC
- CHANGED:  Two point features labeled Bayankhongor in Mongolia. Kept the ’southern’
        point, delete the northern one. Southern feature featureType changed to
        “Admin-1 cap”.
